# Hyperframes Editor — Workspace Guide

HTML-native video workspace built on [Hyperframes](https://hyperframes.heygen.com). Scaffolded 2026-04-17 from the `product-promo` example. Not a Remotion project — this is the other pipeline.

**This workspace hosts multiple video projects, one folder each, all under `video-projects/`.** The workspace root holds shared tooling (`node_modules/`, `package.json`, `.claude/`, this `CLAUDE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md`) — never put `index.html`, `assets/`, `compositions/`, or `renders/` directly at the root. Always work from inside a project subfolder.

## Brand & Knowledge Sources — READ BEFORE ANY VIDEO

Brand, voice, and content come from external source-of-truth repos, **referenced (not copied)** so they stay current. **`DESIGN.md` (workspace root) is the source map** — read it before Gate 2 (script/voice) and Gate 3 (style) of any video.

- **Visual brand** (colors, type, logo) → your design system, if configured (find it by its token file; see `DESIGN.md`). No design system yet → the neutral `assets/brand-tokens.css` placeholder + MOTION_PHILOSOPHY defaults apply.
- **Content, voice, research** → **Daniel's live Second Brain** vault (find it by its signature file `knowledge/_index.md`) — the single source of truth, **never copied**

Both are reachable via `.claude/settings.local.json` (machine-local) and are **read-only** — never write to them. Don't assume fixed paths; locate each source by its signature file. If a source isn't accessible, tell the user to set up `.claude/settings.local.json` (see `.claude/settings.local.json.example`) before building. See `DESIGN.md` for exactly which files to read for each decision.

## MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md — READ BEFORE BRAINSTORMING

**`MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md` (at the workspace root) is the motion-graphics *discipline* for this workspace** — pacing, transitions, structure, the rule of threes. It is a deconstructed motion playbook (originally derived from the Infinite Global Payments spot).

**Your brand overrides the visual layer.** Where MOTION_PHILOSOPHY specifies palette, type fill, or texture, `DESIGN.md` (your brand source map) wins. Define your headline treatment in your brand tokens — there is no brand gradient baked in here. Keep MOTION_PHILOSOPHY's *discipline*; take color, type, and logo from your brand.

**You MUST read it before:**
- Brainstorming a new composition, scene, or storyboard
- Proposing a visual direction, palette, or pacing
- Picking transitions, animations, or registry blocks
- Designing any kinetic typography, logo reveal, or product showcase

**How to use it:**
1. **Always read the full file** at the start of any creative session — `Read MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md` from the workspace root. Don't skim, don't quote from memory. The doc evolves.
2. **Re-read sections 0 (10 Laws) and 4 (pre-flight checklist)** every time, even on quick iterations. They are the discipline.
3. **Apply the defaults**: ~1.5s avg scene length, dark canvas + perspective grid + crosshairs + vignette + grain on every scene, headline type in your brand's headline treatment (define it in your brand tokens) with halo glow, motion-blurred whip transitions (never hard cuts), ≤5 symbolic colors, hold the outro 4–6s, rule of threes.
4. **Use the recipes**: section 3 has copy-pasteable HyperFrames patterns (composition shell, kinetic-type opener, whip-streak, color-recolor trick, registry block mappings).
5. **Run the pre-flight checklist** before claiming any motion piece is done. The "What Would Infinite Do?" 10-question test in section 5 is a good gut check before showing the user.

**When NOT to apply it:**
- If a specific video calls for a different texture than the default, keep the *discipline* (one idea per beat, motion in transitions, breathing outros, callbacks) but always pull *palette, type, and logo* from your `DESIGN.md` sources.

If `MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md` is missing from the workspace root, stop and ask the user before brainstorming — it should always be there.

## Skills — USE THESE FIRST

**Always invoke the matching skill before writing or modifying compositions.** Skills encode framework-specific patterns (`window.__timelines` registration, `data-*` attribute semantics, shader-compatible CSS, relative-timing syntax) that are NOT in generic web docs. Skipping them produces broken compositions.

| Skill                    | Command                    | When to use                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hyperframes`            | `/hyperframes`             | Authoring/editing compositions, captions, TTS, audio-reactive animation, transitions      |
| `hyperframes-cli`        | `/hyperframes-cli`         | CLI commands: `init`, `add`, `lint`, `preview`, `render`, `transcribe`, `tts`, `doctor`   |

### Render flags worth knowing

- `--quality draft|standard|high` — CRF 28 / 18 / 15 (standard is visually lossless at 1080p)
- `--fps 24|30|60` (default 30)
- `--format mp4|mov|webm` — `mov` = ProRes 4444 with alpha, `webm` = VP9 alpha (Chromium only)
- `--workers <n>` / `--gpu` / `--docker` / `--crf <n>` / `--video-bitrate 10M`
- `--max-concurrent-renders <n>` — when running the producer server

## Workspace Layout

```
Hyperframes Editor/
├── CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, DESIGN.md            ← workspace docs (DESIGN.md = brand source map)
├── MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md                    ← motion-graphics discipline (READ before brainstorming)
├── package.json, node_modules/              ← workspace tooling
├── .claude/                                  ← skills + plugin config + settings.local.json
├── assets/                                   ← shared raw media (source clips, music)
└── video-projects/                           ← one folder per video
    └── sample-project/
```

Each project under `video-projects/<name>/` is a self-contained Hyperframes project:

- `index.html` — root composition entry point
- `compositions/` — sub-compositions loaded via `data-composition-src`
  - `compositions/components/` — shared snippets installed by `npx hyperframes add <component>`
- `assets/` — media files for this project (videos, audio, images, SVG, transcripts). Brand binaries the renderer needs (your fonts, your logo) are copied per-project from your design-system source, not symlinked — keeps each project portable.
- `renders/` — render outputs for this project (gitignored)
- `hyperframes.json` — CLI config (registry URL, paths — all relative to the project folder)
- `meta.json` — project metadata (id, name, dimensions, fps)
- (optional) `STORYBOARD.md`, `scripts/`, etc. — anything project-specific

### Always run the CLI from inside the project folder

```bash
cd video-projects/sample-project
npx hyperframes lint
npx hyperframes preview
npx hyperframes render --quality standard --output renders/final.mp4
```

The CLI reads `hyperframes.json`/`meta.json` from the current directory and resolves `assets/`, `compositions/`, `renders/` relative to it. Running it from the workspace root will fail or scan the wrong files.

### Adding a new video project

1. `mkdir video-projects/<new-project-slug>` (kebab-case, e.g. `q3-launch-promo`)
2. `cd video-projects/<new-project-slug>`
3. Either `npx hyperframes init` to scaffold, or copy the structure from a sibling project (`cp -r ../sample-project/{hyperframes.json,meta.json} .` then edit `meta.json` for the new id/name/dimensions, and create empty `index.html`, `compositions/`, `assets/`, `renders/`)
4. Copy the brand binaries the renderer needs (your fonts and logo) from your design-system source into this project's `assets/`, if configured — see `DESIGN.md`.
5. Build the composition; lint + render from inside this folder

### What lives at the workspace root

- **Motion-graphics discipline:** `MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md` (pacing/transitions/structure — read before brainstorming any composition; your `DESIGN.md` overrides its palette/type/logo)
- **Brand & content source map:** `DESIGN.md` (points at your design system for visual brand and Daniel's Second Brain for content/voice — see the Brand & Knowledge Sources section above)
- Shared raw-recording stash: large source MP4s/MP3s that aren't yet assigned to a project (e.g. raw lesson recordings, license-free music) can sit at root until they're moved into a project's `assets/`
- Tooling: `node_modules/`, `package.json`, `.claude/`, `.gitignore`, `skills-lock.json`

## Render Contract (the must-dos and must-not-dos)

1. Root `<div>` needs `id`, `data-composition-id`, `data-start="0"`, `data-width`, `data-height`.
2. Timed visible elements need `class="clip"` — **except** `<video>` and `<audio>` (adding `class="clip"` to `<video>` breaks it).
3. Every timed element needs `data-start`, `data-duration`, `data-track-index`.
4. `data-start` can reference another clip's id: `data-start="intro"`, `data-start="intro + 2"`, `data-start="intro - 0.5"`. Same-track clips cannot overlap — use different `data-track-index` values.
5. `<video>` must be `muted`; audio belongs in sibling `<audio>` elements for the mixer. `data-has-audio="true"` only when the video's own audio should feed the mix.
6. Every composition registers exactly one GSAP timeline, paused, on `window.__timelines["<data-composition-id>"]`. Key must match `data-composition-id` exactly.
7. Composition duration = `tl.duration()`. If the timeline is shorter than the video, the video truncates. Pad with `tl.set({}, {}, <seconds>)` to extend.
8. Never call `.play()`, `.pause()`, or set `.currentTime` on media. The framework owns playback.
9. Never animate `width`/`height`/`top`/`left` directly on a `<video>` — the browser freezes frames. Wrap in a `<div>` and animate the wrapper.
10. Sub-compositions use `<template>` + `data-composition-src`. Their timelines auto-link to the parent — never do `masterTL.add(child)`.
11. Determinism: no `Date.now()`, no unseeded `Math.random()`, no render-time network fetches. Use seeded PRNGs.

## Authoring Loop

1. **Read `MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md`** if you haven't this session — it sets the motion baseline (1–2s scenes, motion-blur transitions, etc.). Take palette/type/logo from your `DESIGN.md`, not from MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.
2. Pick the skill → invoke `/hyperframes` (or sibling) before editing.
3. Edit HTML in `index.html` or `compositions/<name>.html`.
4. `npx hyperframes lint` — fix errors, triage warnings.
5. **Localhost Studio preview** — before **any** render (even a draft), start `npx hyperframes preview` in the background and hand the user the URL. He eyeballs the edit live and iterates; no render cycle until he's seen it. See "Localhost Preview Before Any Render" below.
6. Only after the user says the live preview looks right: `render --quality draft` for a draft MP4.
7. **Visual verification** (REQUIRED before handoff) — see "Visual Verification" below.
8. **Run the `MOTION_PHILOSOPHY.md` pre-flight checklist** (section 4) before claiming done.
9. Second localhost preview pass on the draft MP4 (via static server on port 8080 for scrubbable playback) — wait for explicit sign-off before the final render.
10. Final: `render --quality standard` (or `high --docker` for archival deterministic output).

## Visual Verification (MANDATORY before delivery)

Lint passing ≠ design working. Never tell the user a render is done until you have actually looked at the frames. No exceptions. A "successful" render with a cropped face, misaligned text, or a scene landing on the wrong word is a broken render — and lint exit codes will not catch any of that. the user has explicitly asked for this gate — treat skipping it as a regression.

**Required checks before delivery:**

1. Render a draft: `npx hyperframes render --quality draft --output renders/<name>-draft.mp4`
2. Pull one frame per scene at its hero moment, plus frames at any mid-entrance or transition at risk. Cover the full timeline — don't cherry-pick.
   ```bash
   mkdir -p renders/frames
   for t in <scene1-t> <scene2-t> ...; do
     ffmpeg -y -ss $t -i renders/<name>-draft.mp4 -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 "renders/frames/t${t}.png"
   done
   ```
3. Call `Read` on every PNG so the image actually loads into context. Do NOT just list filenames. Verify:
   - Speaker's face is not cropped in any bottom-half scene
   - Full-screen vs bottom-half face mode is correct for each scene
   - Scene transitions land on the intended word
   - Captions are on-brand per your `DESIGN.md` (your font + accent color) and readable
   - No text overflow, no unintentional overlap, no blank frames
4. If anything is wrong — fix, re-render, re-verify. Never ship a broken render and let the user find the bug.
5. Only then run the `standard` quality render and report the path.

**Pre-render (live scrubbing):** Playwright 1.59.1 is installed. For quick contrast/layout checks on a single scene mid-authoring without paying a full render, run `npx hyperframes preview` (opens on localhost:3002) and drive Playwright to screenshot the live state at specific timestamps. Useful when iterating on one scene's visual balance before committing to a draft render.

## Localhost Preview Before Any Render (MANDATORY)

**Every edit pass gets two preview gates**: one on the live Studio **before** any render (so the user can iterate on cheap edits without waiting for a render), and one on the rendered MP4 **before** the final `--quality standard` bake. Do not run `render --quality draft` OR `render --quality standard` until the user has eyeballed the relevant state in his browser.

### Gate 1 — Live Studio preview (before any render)

After editing compositions and before any render command:

1. Start Studio in the background:
   ```bash
   cd video-projects/<project-slug>
   npx hyperframes preview    # run_in_background: true
   ```
2. Wait for "Studio running" on http://localhost:3002.
3. Hand the user the URL + tell him exactly which sub-compositions to scrub (individual comp URLs load fastest — the master composition can stall when it includes WebGL shader blocks under software WebGL fallback). Example: `http://localhost:3002/?comp=v01-kinetic-type`.
4. Wait for the user's explicit sign-off on the live preview ("looks good, render a draft" / "ship it" / "go ahead"). Silence is not approval.
5. Hot reload means any further edit you make shows up live without a restart.

### Gate 2 — Rendered MP4 preview (before final)

After frame-verification passes on a draft render:

6. Serve `renders/` via `npx serve . -p 8080 -n` (NOT Python's `http.server` — it doesn't support HTTP Range requests, so scrubbing breaks). Hand the user `http://localhost:8080/<project>-draft.mp4`.
7. Wait for explicit sign-off on the full motion + audio playback.
8. Then run the final `--quality standard` render; report the output path.

Why two gates: the live Studio catches layout/timing/visual bugs on edits you just made — before spending ~2 minutes per render iteration. The rendered-MP4 gate catches pacing, audio sync, and beat-to-beat feel that only reads correctly in real-time playback. Skipping either one turns render cycles into expensive guesses.

**If the master composition stalls in Studio** (software WebGL + multiple shader blocks): route the user to individual sub-composition URLs instead. They load instantly and isolate the change you're previewing.

The render is the ground truth. "The code looks correct" doesn't clear the bar.

## Asset Prep

Re-encode raw recordings to H.264 MP4 before referencing as `<video src>`:

```bash
ffmpeg -i raw.mov -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 20 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart assets/clip.mp4
```

Keeps `assets/` light and avoids codec issues during capture. Use `npx hyperframes doctor` if a render fails partway.

## Prompting Shorthand (what the `/hyperframes` skill understands)

- **Motion easing:** smooth / snappy / bouncy / springy / dramatic / dreamy
- **Caption energy:** hype / corporate / tutorial / storytelling / social
- **Transition energy:** calm (blur) / medium (push) / high (zoom, glitch)
- **Audio reactivity:** bass→scale, treble→glow, amplitude→opacity, mids→shape. Keep text reactivity at 3–6%; backgrounds can go 10–30%.

Cold-start prompt shape: *"Using /hyperframes, create a 10-second product intro with a fade-in title over a dark background and subtle background music."* Warm-start: *"Summarize this PDF into a 45-second pitch video using /hyperframes."*

## Registry (available via `npx hyperframes add <name>`)

- **Blocks (38):** data viz (`data-chart`, `flowchart`), outros (`logo-outro`), social overlays (`instagram-follow`, `tiktok-follow`, `yt-lower-third`, `x-post`, `reddit-post`, `spotify-card`, `macos-notification`), app/UI (`app-showcase`, `ui-3d-reveal`), shader transitions (`glitch`, `whip-pan`, `cinematic-zoom`, `flash-through-white`, `light-leak`, `ripple-waves`, `chromatic-radial-split`, `cross-warp-morph`, `domain-warp-dissolve`, `gravitational-lens`, `ridged-burn`, `sdf-iris`, `swirl-vortex`, `thermal-distortion`), CSS transition packs (`transitions-3d|blur|cover|destruction|dissolve|distortion|grid|light|mechanical|other|push|radial|scale`)
- **Components (3):** `grain-overlay`, `shimmer-sweep`, `grid-pixelate-wipe`
- Browse: `npx hyperframes catalog --type block --json`

## Documentation — fetch when the skills don't cover enough

The `/hyperframes*` skills encode the common authoring patterns, but the hosted docs are the source of truth for **every block's props, every package's API, and deeper usage examples**. Reach for them when brainstorming scenes, picking a transition or component, or digging into a package you haven't used before. The catalog pages in particular hide a lot of gems — don't guess at a block's props, fetch the page.

**Entry points:**

- **Agent index (fetch first if unsure of a path):** https://hyperframes.heygen.com/llms.txt — the complete sitemap
- **Full site:** https://hyperframes.heygen.com/introduction
- **Inline terminal docs:** `npx hyperframes docs <topic>` — topics: `data-attributes`, `gsap`, `rendering`, `examples`, `troubleshooting`, `compositions`
- **Source repo:** https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes

**Known URL patterns (hit directly with WebFetch):**

- **Catalog — Blocks (38):** `https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/blocks/<slug>` — e.g. `instagram-follow`, `flowchart`, `data-chart`, `cinematic-zoom`, `glitch`, `whip-pan`, `sdf-iris`, `light-leak`, `logo-outro`, `app-showcase`, `ui-3d-reveal`, `macos-notification`, plus all the transition packs (`transitions-3d`, `transitions-blur`, …). Full props + examples for each.
- **Catalog — Components (3):** `https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/components/<slug>` — `grain-overlay`, `grid-pixelate-wipe`, `shimmer-sweep`
- **Packages:** `https://hyperframes.heygen.com/packages/<name>` — `cli`, `core`, `engine`, `player`, `producer`, `studio`. Use when scripting beyond HTML (e.g. batch rendering via producer, player runtime hooks).
- **Reference:** `https://hyperframes.heygen.com/reference/html-schema` — authoritative data-attribute + timeline-registration spec
- **Core concepts & guides:** listed in `llms.txt` — covers compositions, deterministic rendering, frame adapters, GSAP animation, prompt guide, website-to-video, troubleshooting, common mistakes. Fetch `llms.txt` to resolve exact paths.

**When to reach for this:** brainstorming a new scene ("what block could sell this beat?"), looking up a block's exact props before wiring it into a composition, deep-diving into a package API, or debugging something the render contract doesn't explain.
